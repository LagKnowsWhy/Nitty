    <p>Nitty - simple discord.js bot
    Nitty, the discord utility bot
    Made for the hazelnitwit and his collaborators
    This bot and it's code are NOT guaranteed for use outside of hazelnitwit's umbrella. Be warned.
    The bot utilizes discord.js version 14.7.1 and the project is linted using ESLint version 8.32.0 
    (Please note that a default `.eslintrc.json` file is NOT included, and be warned that my code is nowhere near easily readable)
    Packages are compiled using `npm pack` and can be initialized using `npm init`
    This is my first project involving JS in many years, so I am rusty, and there will likely be many revisions and commits.

    To contact me, you can:
    Email: hazel@thenitwit.xyz
    Discord: hazelnitwit#0001 OR https://discord.gg/zV4KuWMCzx (my bot development server)
    (Always preface that you are from GitHub if you are approaching me via email or my personal Discord rather than the server.)</p>
