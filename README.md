# Nitty
### Nitty, the discord utility bot
### Made for the HAZiY VTuber group, by hazelnitwit

[This bot and it's code are NOT guaranteed for use outside of hazelnitwit's umbrella. Be warned.]

The bot utilizes discord.js version 14.7.1 and the project is linted using ESLint version 8.32.0 

(Please note that a default `.eslintrc.json` file is NOT included, and be warned that my code is nowhere near easily readable)

This is my first project involving JS in many years, so I am rusty, and there will likely be many revisions and commits.

To contact me, you can:

Email: hazel@thenitwit.xyz

Discord: hazelnitwit#0001 OR https://discord.gg/zV4KuWMCzx (my bot development server)

(Always preface that you are from GitHub, please)
